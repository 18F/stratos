> **NOTE** This is a work-in-progress Angular 2.x version of Stratos UI. For the current Angular 1 based version see [https://github.com/SUSE/stratos-ui](https://github.com/SUSE/stratos-ui). This version is at an early development stage and we welcome feedback, input and contributions. This version does not have feature parity with the Angular 1 version.
